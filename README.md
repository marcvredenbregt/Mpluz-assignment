# Mpluz* Assignment

This is a lightweight TypeScript project to get you started with your Mpluz* assignment.

It uses `jest` for testing, `prettier` for formatting, and `typedoc` for document generation.

`npm run lint` will compare your code against the linter settings. This repository is set to use `spaces` for indentation and single quotes for strings.

`npm run test` will run your tests. For a coverage report, use `npm run test:coverage`. And to have tests watch for changes and automatically re-run, use `npm run test:watch`.

`npm run start:watch` will run `App.ts` and re-run on changes.
